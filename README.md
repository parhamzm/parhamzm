### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am an AI researcher specializing in **Deep Learning**, **Generative Models**, and **Computer Vision**. I recently graduated with an M.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the University of Tehran, where I was ranked 1st in my cohort. My research is driven by a passion for creating efficient and novel AI models to solve complex, real-world problems.

Currently, I am a **Researcher at the Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI)**, where I am contributing to **Fanar**, an Arabic-centric multimodal generative AI platform.

### 🚀 My Current Focus

* **Generative AI for Cultural Alignment**: Contributing to the development of image generation models for the Fanar project at QCRI.
* **Voice Adaptation**: Designing a pioneering generative network for voice adaptation in speech processing at the University of Tehran's Computer Vision Lab.
* **AI Model Optimization**: Enhancing the efficiency of GANs and LSTMs using neural network acceleration techniques for applications in video compression and portable healthcare.
